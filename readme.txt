Calculator Program

This calculator was developed as part of the certification program awarded by the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, specifically focusing on Python for Beginners.
As Malinga Rajapaksha, I programmed this application using Python, showcasing my skills in software development and proficiency in the Python programming language. 
This project reflects my commitment to continuous learning and the application of programming concepts in real-world scenarios.

- `final.py` fully coded by me
- `History_feature.py` source code provided by the university to add a new feature, `history()`.
